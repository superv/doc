# Frontend Development

We had installed the main admin panel addon during the main installation.

This is a actually nothing more than a scaffolded Vue CLI project providing a VueJS Single Page Application using the `@superv/ui` NPM package. This is pre-transpiled for you so that you can start using superV quickly.

As you might have guessed you can customize this to suit your needs.

Let's start with installing the project dependencies:
```bash
cd addons/superv/drops/acp/js
npm install 
```

Fire up the development server:
```bash
npm run serve
```
