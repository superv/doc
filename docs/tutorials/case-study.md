# Case Study

As a case study we will build the admin and the client panel for a sample e-commerce application. 

Please keep in mind that, we will focus on the building the panel to demonstrate superV features rather than diving in to the real business logic. 

Objectives:
- Build the Admin Panel
- Build the Client Panel
