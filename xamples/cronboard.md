Cronboard - a scheduled tasks dashboard for Laravel applications
Hello everyone!

My name is Stefan and I’ve been working with Laravel for quite a while now (probably for the last 6 or so years). For the better part of the past year I’ve also been spending my free time on side project, with the goal to improve the life of Laravel developers. The application I’m building has helped me with some of the other projects I’m working on, but in the end I’d like for the whole community to benefit from it, provided there’s enough interest.

What I’m building is Cronboard - a dashboard for the Laravel scheduler component and scheduled tasks in general. The main goal is to give greater control over these, specifically when you have a live application.

The main points I’m addressing are managing schedules, defining new / custom tasks, tracking, and testing.

Here’s a list of the most important features or use cases that my project addresses:

Deep integration with Laravel makes it extremely easy and quick to set up

Supports the full range of scheduler settings, and allows you to modify and manage scheduled tasks

Tracks task executions and their performance, and allows for custom metrics to be recorded with each execution

Discovers every piece of executable code within your codebase and enables you to convert that to a scheduled job, without having to touch your codebase

Provides the ability to override parameters for scheduled jobs, and trigger one-off executions for them

Makes testing of scheduled tasks easier - you could override parameters or environment settings and run jobs in that context

As of this week I’ve started a private beta and would love to get some feedback from the community. Anything that would help YOU in particular, in that context - I would like to know.

If you’d like to try it out with your own project - you can sign up for the early access list here: https://cronboard.io

I’ve also set up a demo account - you’ll be able use that to try the project right away if you want :) More info can again be found on the website.

I’m looking forward to any feedback, ideas or requests!

UPDATE:
Oh, wow, my first reddit gold ever! Thank you kind stranger! I'm glad other people see the potential and usefulness in what I'm doing.
